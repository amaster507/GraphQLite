# GraphQLite

A limited feature Dgraph like GraphQL API and database.

[Dgraph Discuss Topic Idea](https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/call-for-collaboration-designing-a-dgraph-offline-first-library/9293?u=amaster507)

Dgraph is a great graph database with a native GraphQL API endpoint. Dgraph however, has been designed for deployments on servers and not client workstations. The goal of this collaborated project is to achieve a lite database that is somewhat similar to Dgraph, yet can be deployed on client workstations with limited resources.

What SQLite is to SQL, GraphQLite is inteded to be for Dgraph.

View the [Project Board](https://github.com/amaster507/GraphQLite/projects) to get involved in the idea phase for this.
